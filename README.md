Declarative GUI for VST plugins.

![basic example](https://i.imgur.com/pj1ZGca.png)

NOTE: If you want to run this you need a font.ttf in the current working directory.

TODO:
- eliminate font rendering artifacts
- allow fixed sized widgets instead of making everything proportional
- skeuomorphic 3d knobs

Contributions welcome!

### Font
Examples require a font named `font.ttf` to be present in the current working directory.
